# Store_management
The store management project is written in Java and it takes a series of dishes and its price to show on the console when running it. It then asks if the user needs to sell a dish; if so, then the dish will be eliminated from the list. The core of this project is the inheritance of Java class, which expands one parent class into many other classes that share similar features. Thus, you can simply change the detailed information of different dishes to let the program work whatever you want! It would be better if you have a csv file to store all the dish information and update the csv whenever making changes.

## How to import it into your computer:
Download each .java file into your computer.
Import all the .java files into a Java IDE of your choice.
(Optional) Change the name and price information of each dishes to whatever you want.
